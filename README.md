# Brandeis-Ticketing-System

This app is a mobile ticketing service for Brandeis University events. All ticket events listed by the Brandeis Box Office will be available for purchase and view. Once a ticket is purchased, a unique QR code will be generated and can be used to verify tickets at the event venue. Verification will be done through a separate admin version of the app. The user side of the app will also have other information like purchased tickets, information about the venue (date / time / location / seat number).
